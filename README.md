# vue-start-spa

## About the project
In preperation for starting to become a software developer, I started to learn how to build a website with Vue.js

This is the second part of this learning journey. For the first part check https://github.com/WietekeNederkoorn/my-vue.js-website

A few things I worked on:
- Starting a project from scratch
- Applying CSS to components
- How to bring in CSS from external source
- using the created() lifecycle event to load data
- Working with unset props
- Deciding when to load data
- Working with forms
- Validating forms
- Updating and filtering data
